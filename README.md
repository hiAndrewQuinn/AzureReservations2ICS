Modern Python Starter Kit
=========================

[A long time back](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720110726/https://leafy-taiyaki-59fd85.netlify.app/)
I wrote a long document called the "Modern Python Checklist."
I later decided to wipe my Github, which I'm still mostly happy
I did, but I found myself increasingly missing as I wanted to
spin up new projects in the world's programming lingua franca.

Hence, this starter project. Everything I wanted has been
reimplemented here, free of charge, and free of any
expectation that you keep it under some dumb copyleft
license. Take this with you as you conquer the world.
